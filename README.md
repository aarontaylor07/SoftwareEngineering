# SoftwareEngineering
Node and React JS Project for Engineering, to create a website for student information. Contains basic information about students in an easy to use website. 

Data on students is mocked up and names of students are generated using the Wu-Tang Names Generator or by our own great imaginations.

Tests are written in the Mocha Framework.

# To Run
run "npm install" then "npm start" from the root project directory, then you should be able to access at http://localhost:3000/

# To Test
Run "npm test", tests are under the tests folder. The application has to be running at localhost on port 3000 for any test with "View" in the name to work.
